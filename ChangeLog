#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2003-10-10  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.04 -- minor bugfix version

	* Added some code to insulate Pod::Simple to runtime changes in
	the value of $/.  Thanks to Iain Truskett for catching this.
	* Added FILENO method to TiedOutFH.pm, to work quietly under some
	perls.  Thanks to Jochen Stenzel for catching this.
	* Fixed some tests that erroneously failed under some 5.6's
	because of chdir()s in *.t files messing up @INC  Thanks to many
	who caught this, including Rocco Caputo.
	
2003-09-07  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.03 -- minor upgrade
	* A =head[1234] command now closes any currently open =over, and
	warns.
	* Fixing a few obscure bugs, including one to do with the
	Makefile.
	* Added some tests for those bugs.
	
2003-09-02  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.02 -- fixing a testing bug
	* Autrijus Tang found a silly bug of mine in corpustest.t's
	testing of corpus/t/nonesuch.txt.  Fixed,
	* I add encoding_nonesuch.t to test corpus/t/nonesuch.txt better.

	
2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 2.01
	* Moved all version numbers up to 2.01 for reasons of Tibetan
	numerology.

	* Implemented =encoding.  Thanks a million to Jarkko, Autrijus,
	Dan Kogai, and many others for their help, patience, and
	encouragement.

	It's not yet documented, but see ./t/corpus/*.txt for examples at
	least.

	* Added 'use utf8' to all the modules.  Byebye perl-5.005
	compatibility, hello decent perl-5.6 compatibility.

2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.98
	* At Michael Schwern's suggestion, a list that begins with a
	"=item [number]" line where number isn't a 1, is no longer
	treated as an error, but instead is silently coerced into being a
	text-item list, just as if it were "=item wubble" or whatever.
	
2003-08-12  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.97
	* Loooking goooooood.  Not smelling so much like beta anymore!
	* I think this might be the last version before I go
	putting "use utf8" all over the place.

	* Added placefolders for "=encoding" support.  If you use
	"=encoding", you'll get an error about "not yet implemented"
	instead of "unknown directive".

	* Rewrote Pod::Simple::Pullparser's get_title, and added
	get_version, get_author, and get_description.  Documented them.
	Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing an initial get_title and
	then being patient while I seemed to do nothing with it for months
	on end!
	
	* More tests.
	
	Otherwise just minor changes since last version:
	* Fixed error in Pod::Simple::RTF.
	* Added new but undocumented methods to Pod::Simple:
           unaccept_directive(s) unaccept_target(s) unaccept_code(s)
	* Corrected '=back without =open' error to '=back without =over'
	* A little tweaking to the _verbatim_format code.
	* Dump routines may use \x{NN} instead of \xNN format.
	* Pod::Simple::HTML now uses VerbatimFormatted
	* A few changes ot DEBUG messages -- nothing you'd normally see.
	
2002-11-19  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.96
	* Still kinda sorta beta.

	* Much much more docs in this version.  Only a few feature
	changes:

	* Added any_errata_seen to Pod::Simple.  Should've been in there
	ages ago.  Oops!
	* Fixed some errors in the experimental VerbatimFormatted code.
	* Added is_tagname / is_tag to Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken
	and Pod::Simple::PullParserEndToken
