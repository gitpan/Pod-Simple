# ChangeLog for Pod::Simple dist     # Time-stamp: "2003-09-01 20:52:05 ADT"

2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.98
	* At Michael Schwern's suggestion, a list that begins with a
	"=item [number]" line where number isn't a 1, is no longer
	treated as an error, but instead is silently coerced into being a
	text-item list, just as if it were "=item wubble" or whatever.
	
2003-08-12  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.97
	* Loooking goooooood.  Not smelling so much like beta anymore!
	* I think this might be the last version before I go
	putting "use utf8" all over the place.

	* Added placefolders for "=encoding" support.  If you use
	"=encoding", you'll get an error about "not yet implemented"
	instead of "unknown directive".

	* Rewrote Pod::Simple::Pullparser's get_title, and added
	get_version, get_author, and get_description.  Documented them.
	Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing an initial get_title and
	then being patient while I seemed to do nothing with it for months
	on end!
	
	* More tests.
	
	Otherwise just minor changes since last version:
	* Fixed error in Pod::Simple::RTF.
	* Added new but undocumented methods to Pod::Simple:
           unaccept_directive(s) unaccept_target(s) unaccept_code(s)
	* Corrected '=back without =open' error to '=back without =over'
	* A little tweaking to the _verbatim_format code.
	* Dump routines may use \x{NN} instead of \xNN format.
	* Pod::Simple::HTML now uses VerbatimFormatted
	* A few changes ot DEBUG messages -- nothing you'd normally see.
	
2002-11-19  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Release 0.96
	* Still kinda sorta beta.

	* Much much more docs in this version.  Only a few feature
	changes:

	* Added any_errata_seen to Pod::Simple.  Should've been in there
	ages ago.  Oops!
	* Fixed some errors in the experimental VerbatimFormatted code.
	* Added is_tagname / is_tag to Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken
	and Pod::Simple::PullParserEndToken
	* Added RTFDEFLANG stuff to Pod::Simple::RTF.
	
2002-11-10  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>

	still to add.  The APIs might change in future versions.

	* Now including perlpod and perlpodspec in the dist.

	* Pod::Simple -- added parse_from_file
	* Pod::Simple::RTF -- minor style changes, and minor change to the
	RTF-wrapping logic.

	fatal(ish) error.
	* Pod::Simple::BlackBox -- added experimental new
	VerbatimFormatted stuff.

	added ->tag as an alias for ->tagname.
	* Pod::Simple and Pod::Simple::BlackBox -- added tolerance for
	"=item * Foo" as a variant syntax for "=item *\n\nFoo".  Tests
	added/changed accordingly.
	* Pod::Simple::HTML -- added <a name="..."> stuff, and a hack at
	doing something with X<...>'s.
